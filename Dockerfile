# =============================================================================
# Eco-Travel Advisor — single-container image
# =============================================================================
# Built to deploy on HuggingFace Spaces (Docker SDK) in one click: Spaces
# builds this Dockerfile and routes all external traffic to ONE port
# (see EXPOSE / README.md's `app_port`). Internally, start.sh runs all
# four processes (flight data service, Rasa action server, Rasa server,
# Streamlit dashboard) and only Streamlit is reachable from outside — the
# other three talk to each other over localhost inside the same container.
#
# For local development where you want the four pieces properly isolated
# (closer to a real production topology), use docker-compose.yml instead,
# which builds this SAME image but runs each service in its own container.

# curl: used by start.sh to wait for each service to be ready before
# starting the next one. build-essential: a couple of Rasa's dependencies
# need a C compiler if no prebuilt wheel matches this exact platform.
